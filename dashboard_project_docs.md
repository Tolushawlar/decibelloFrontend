## Security Considerations

### Authentication Middleware

- Role-based access control for all protected routes
- JWT token validation for authenticated requests
- Route protection based on user roles:
  - `/api/admin/*` - Admin only
  - `/api/staff/*` - Staff only
  - `/api/applicant/*` - Job applicants only

### Data Validation

- Input sanitization for all form submissions
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Design Principles

### UI/UX Guidelines

- McKinsey-inspired professional design
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessible navigation and forms
- Consistent branding across all pages
- Intuitive user flows for each dashboard

### Performance Considerations

- Optimized API responses with pagination
- Efficient database queries
- Compressed assets and images
- Caching strategies for static content
- Lazy loading for dashboard components

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend Testing

- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- User interaction testing
- Form validation testing

### Backend Testing

- API endpoint testing
- Authentication flow testing
- Database integration testing
- Security vulnerability testing

### End-to-End Testing

- Complete user journeys for each role
- Integration between frontend and backend
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance under load
